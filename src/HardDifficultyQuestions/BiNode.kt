// Consider a simple data structure called BiNode, which has pointer to two other nodes:
// class BiNode {
//    var node1:BiNode
//    var node2:BiNode
//    var data: Int
// }
// The data structure BiNode could be used to represent both a binary tree (where node1 is the left node and node2 is
// the right node). Implement a method to convert a binary search tree (implemented with BiNode) into a doubly linked
// list. The values should be kept in order and the operation should be performed in place (that is, on the original
// data structure).
