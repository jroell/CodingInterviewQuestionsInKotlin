// An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we
// cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. the elements of A are represented in binary, and the
// only operation we can use to access them is "fetch the jth bit of A[i]," which takes constant time. Write code to
// find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?
