// You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in a lengthy document. A sentence like
// "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!" became "iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot". You'll deal with the
// punctuation and capitalization later; right now you need to re-insert the spaces. Most of the words are in a
// dictionary but a few are not. Given a dictionary (a list of strings) and the document (a string), design an
// algorithm to unconcatenate the document in a way that minimizes the number of unrecognized characters.

// Example:
// Input: jesslookedjustliketimherbrother
// Output: jess looked just like tim her brother (7 unrecognized characters)
