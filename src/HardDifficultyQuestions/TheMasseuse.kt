// A popular masseuse receives a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests asn is debating which ones to accept.
// She needs a 155- minute break between appointments and therefore she cannot accept any adjacent requests. Given a
// sequence of back-to-back appointments requests (all multiples of 15 minutes, non overlap, and none can be moved),
// find the optimal (highest total booked minutes) set the masseuse can honor. Return the number of minutes.

// Example:
// Input: {30, 15, 60, 75, 45, 15, 15, 45}
// Output: 180 minutes ({30, 60, 45, 45}).
