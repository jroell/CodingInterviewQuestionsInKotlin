// You have a stack of n boxes, with width w, heights h, and depth d. The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be
// stacked on top of one another if each box wn the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width, height,
// and depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest possible stack. The height of a stack is the
// sum of the heights of each box.
