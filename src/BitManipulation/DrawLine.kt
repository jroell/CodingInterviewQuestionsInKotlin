// A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one
// byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height
// of the screen, kof course, can be derived from the length of the array and and the width. Implement a function
// that draws a a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).
